         <p>“Dear Friend,</p>
         <p>Have you been having trouble getting pregnant?</p>
         <p>How does that make you feel? Frustrated? Angry? Humiliated? Embarrassed? Broken or not good enough?</p>
         
         <p>Is it straining your relationship with your spouse (or partner) because you've been trying for months and months with no luck?
        </p>
        <p>
          If this sounds like you, then<strong> don't worry.</strong> You are not alone. In fact, between 10 and 15 percent of Dutch women struggle to conceive—you're in good company!
         </p>
        <p>
          I've spent years studying the science and nature of fertility, and this book is the result. In it is the solution to every fertility problem that could be keeping you from having children. Most women have <strong>no idea how simple</strong> it would be to actually get pregnant, or how to <strong>tap into the little-known secrets of fertility</strong> that reside inside of them. This book can show you how.

        </p>
        <p >
        You're worthy of being a parent. Everyone who wants to have children should be able to have them—and hopefully with a little bit of help, they will!

The stress was intense.
                                        But luckily (and with the help of your book!), we made it through alright—and after years of studying different approaches, I was able to conceive and deliver naturally, just like I'd hoped! I can't thank you enough—I'm due in three weeks!

It turns out that the solution was much easier than we thought it was, and now my husband and I have a beautiful little family! It was almost too late to have our sons naturally, but thanks to you we were able to.

                                        The doctors said we'd need to do special treatments to conceive . . . it was going to cost an extraordinary sum of money that we just didn't have. We were about to give up . . . now we're about to be parents. It's like a miracle—wait, no, it is a miracle!

                                        I'd been trying to avoid getting pregnant for so long that I didn't really know how to go about actually getting pregnant. We didn't know until we started trying that I would have any trouble, but it turns out that I'd been struggling with cysts for a long time. It took a lot of trying, but your book has been a fantastic guide through the entire process. I can't thank you enough!

     <p class="sectionimg02p">Once you've managed to get pregnant, you want to keep your baby healthy. But with the cacophony of advertising out there pointed at expecting mothers, how do you know what's real and what isn't?
    </p>
        
          <p class="sectionimg02p">
      
          Women come to me all the time with this sort of question. “What's good, and what isn't?” they want to know. “Just give me a list of vitamins and supplements, and I'll make sure to go get them.”

        <p class="section04h1">But it's not that simple.</p>
        <div class="section04p1">
          <p>
            I've spent years researching the different types of vitamins supplements that women need to keep their baby healthy throughout their entire pregnancy, and the important thing is this:
            </p><br>
            <p>
            No two pregnancies are the same.
            </p><br>
          <p>
        
          Sure, there are some things that everyone needs (like making sure you have enough calcium). But beyond that, every mother's body is different, and so every pregnancy needs different supplements.
          </p>
        <p><br>
        So how do you know which ones are for you?
        </p><br>
        <p>
        
        I've put everything together in one handy eBook for you to reference as you progress through your pregnancy. From figuring out which vitamins are the most vital to sorting through the avalanche of pregnancy supplements on the market today, it's all there and laid out in a simple, straightforward plan. Just follow the steps and you'll be all set.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Normally this eBook is <strong>price of eBook</strong> </p>



        <p class="section04h1b" >But . . .</p>

        <div class="section04h1p">

          <p>
          For an extremely limited time, I've decided to make it available to everyone who purchases the base book. That's an extra <strong>price of eBook</strong> value for<strong> absolutely free </strong>all of the information you need to navigate the crazy world of pregnancy supplements and keep your baby healthy is wrapped up in one simple package, just for you.
          </p><br>
          <p>
          
          This is going to save you some serious time decoding labels and sorting through advertising fluff, believe me. And it might even help you avoid some of the health problems that usually crop up during pregnancy.
          </p><br>
          <p>
          The eBook is not going to cost you anything extra. All I ask is that you drop me a line and let me know how useful it was. But don't wait too long! I'm going to start charging for it again, and soon!</p>

          <strong>P.S.</strong> It doesn't take long to put these methods into practice. You could be pregnant 12 weeks from now (or even sooner!) with a beautiful little baby boy or baby girl. If you're ready to be a mother, why wait? Order today and get started on the path to motherhood!
          </P>
         <p><strong>P.S.S.</strong> Drugs, surgery, and fertility treatments are all expensive . . . and many of them have nasty side-effects that no one likes to talk about. If you could conceive naturally, then you could save yourself all of the pain and expense of these other methods. Why not give it a try? The
